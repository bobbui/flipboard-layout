#General info
An experimental page layout that let's you navigate pages by swiping or dragging as in a booklet, inspired by Flipboard.

Fork from https://github.com/botelho/flipboard-layout.

Because i can not find any fix for this one so decide to made it myself.
Fixed :
- Tap on tile not working on some mobile device
- Made it working on IE
Tested with IE 11, 12
